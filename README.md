zURL - A URL shortening service
===============================

[zURL](http://zurl.ws/) is a URL shortening service.

Don't expect this code to work "out-of-the-box", as I've had no time to write an installer or anything like that. It's provided as an example of how to code a URL shortener, for anyone that might be interested in that. You'll have to edit some of the code in order to get it working - There's hardcoded references to "zurl.ws" in some of the files, and unfortunately I don't have time to clean all that up :(.
